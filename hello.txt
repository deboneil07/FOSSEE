/section hello world
i want to build a set of basic apps
which might not be better than already made apps
but i want to create my own ecosystem
so for that reason
i want to create a solo org
named ... didnt think yet
it will start with note app, text editor then code editor
i will make them on pyQT
code editor will be ambitious
text editor will contain features hand-crafted
and then slowly i'll dwindle into terminals maybe
/end hello world
